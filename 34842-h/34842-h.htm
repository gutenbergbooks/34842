<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Within the limits of this small collection of pictures
an attempt is made to bring together as great a variety
of subjects as possible. Portraiture is illustrated in the
statue of Sophocles and the bust of Pericles, <i>genre</i> studies
in the Apoxyomenos and Discobolus, bas-relief work
in the panel from the Parthenon frieze and the Orpheus
and Eurydice, and ideal heads and statues in the representations
of the divinities. Both the Greek treatment
of the nude and the Greek management of drapery have
due attention.</p>

<p>As classic literature is the best interpreter of Greek
sculpture, the text draws freely from such original sources
as the Iliad and the Odyssey, the Homeric hymns, and
Ovid's Metamorphoses.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h2><a name="CHARACTERISTICS" id="CHARACTERISTICS"></a>I. ON SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF GREEK SCULPTURE.</h2>

<p>The history of Greek sculpture covers a period of some
eight or nine hundred years, and falls into five divisions.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The first is the period of development, extending from
600 to 480 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> The second is the period of greatest
achievement, under Phidias and his followers, in the Age
of Pericles, 480-430 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> The third is the period of
Praxiteles and Scopas, in the fourth century. The fourth
is the period of decline, characterized as the Hellenistic
Age, and included between the years 320 and 100 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>
The fifth is the Græco-Roman period, which includes the
work produced to meet the demand of the Roman market
for Greek sculpture, and which extends to 300 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span></p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See Gardner's <i>Handbook of Greek Sculpture</i>, page 42.
</div>

<p>Modern criticism differentiates sharply the characteristics
of the several periods and even of the individual artists,
but such subtleties are beyond the grasp of the unlearned.
The majority of people continue to regard Greek sculpture
in its entirety, as if it were the homogeneous product of a
single age. To the popular imagination it is as if some
gigantic machine turned out the Apollo Belvedere, the
Venus of Milo, the Elgin Marbles, and all the rest, in a
single day. Nor is it long ago since even eminent writers
had but vague ideas as to the distinctive periods of these
very works. Certain it is that all works of Greek sculpture
have a particular character which marks them as
such. Authorities have taught us to distinguish some few
of their leading characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of Greek art is perhaps
its closeness to nature. The sculptor showed an
intimate knowledge of the human form, acquired by constant
observation of the splendid specimens of manhood
produced in the palæstra. It is because the artist "clung
to nature as a kind mother," says Waldstein, that the
influence of his work persists through the ages.</p>

<p>Again, Greek art is distinctly an art of generalization,
dealing with types rather than with individuals. This
characteristic is of varying degrees in different periods and
with different sculptors. It is seen in its perfection in the
Elgin Marbles, in exaggeration in the Apollo Belvedere,
and at the minimum in the work of Praxiteles. Yet it is
everywhere sufficiently marked to be indissolubly connected
with Greek sculpture.</p>

<p>The quality of repose, so constantly associated with
Greek sculpture, is another characteristic which varies
with the period and the individual sculptor. Between the
calm dignity of the portrait statue of Sophocles and the
intense muscular concentration of Myron's Discobolus, a
long range of degrees may be included. Yet on the whole,
repose is an essential characteristic of the best Greek
sculpture, provided we do not let our notion of repose exclude
the spirited element. Fine as is the effect of repose
in the Parthenon frieze, the composition is likewise full of
spirit and life.</p>

<p>A distinguishing characteristic of the best Greek sculpture
is its simplicity. Compared with the Gothic sculptors,
the Greeks appear to us, in Ruskin's phrase, as the
"masters of all that was grand, simple, wise and tenderly
human, opposed to the pettiness of the toys of the rest of
mankind." Their work is free from that "vain and mean
decoration"&mdash;the "weak and monstrous error"&mdash;which
disfigures the art of other peoples.</p>

<p>As we turn from one Greek marble to another in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
great sculpture galleries of the world, the best features of
the art impress themselves deeply even upon the untutored
eye. The Greek instinct for pose is unfailing and unsurpassable.
Standing or seated, the attitude is always graceful,
the lines are always fine. The best statues are equally
well composed, viewed from any standpoint. The camera
may describe a circumference about a marble as a centre,
and a photograph made at any point in the circle will show
lines of rhythm and beauty.</p>

<p>The faultless regularity of the Greek profile has passed
into history as the accepted standard of human beauty.
The straight continuous line of brow and nose, the well
moulded chin, the full lip, the small ear, satisfy perfectly
our æsthetic ideals.</p>

<p>The art of sculpture was an essential outgrowth of the
Greek spirit, and perfectly suited the requirements of
Greek thought. In the words of a recent writer, "it was
the consummate expression in art of the genius of a nation
which worshiped physical perfection as the gift of the
immortals, which honored the gods by athletic games and
choral dances, and whose deities wore the flesh and shared
the nature of men."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was moreover a national art,
entering into every phase of public life, and embodying
the Greek sense of national greatness.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> From <i>Italian Cities</i>, by E. H. and E. W. Blashfield.</p></div>

<p>Greek sculpture can be sympathetically understood only
by catching something of the spirit which produced it.
One must shake off the centuries and regard life with the
childlike simplicity of the young world: one must give
imagination free rein. The same attitude of mind which
can enjoy Greek mythology and Greek literature is the
proper attitude for the enjoyment of Greek sculpture.
The best interpreter of a nation's art is the nation's
poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="BOOKS" id="BOOKS"></a>II. ON BOOKS OF REFERENCE.</h2>

<p>Many learned works on the subject of Greek Sculpture
have been written in various languages. Three standard
authorities are the English work by A. S. Murray, "History
of Greek Sculpture," second edition, London, 1890;
the French work by Collignon, "Histoire de la Sculpture
Grecque," Paris, 1892; and the German work by Furtwängler,
translated into English by E. Sellers, "The Masterpieces
of Greek Sculpture," London, 1895. Naturally
these three writers are not always of one opinion, and the
student must turn from one to another to learn all the
arguments concerning a disputed point.</p>

<p>For the practical every-day use of the reader who has
no time to sift the evidences on difficult questions of
archæology, Gardner's "Handbook of Greek Sculpture"
is an excellent outline summary of the history of the subject.</p>

<p>Charles Waldstein's "Essays on the Art of Pheidias,"
New York, 1885, is an exceedingly valuable and suggestive
volume.</p>

<p>Two small books, written in a somewhat popular vein,
make very pleasant reading for those pursuing these
studies: "Studies in Greek Art," by J. E. Harrison,
London, 1885, and "Greek Art on Greek Soil," by J.
M. Hoppin, Boston, 1897.</p>

<p>Besides the works devoted exclusively to the subject of
Greek sculpture, the subject receives due attention in
various general histories of art, of which may be mentioned,
Lucy Mitchell's "History of Ancient Sculpture,"
Lübke's "History of Sculpture," and Von Reber's "History
of Ancient Art."</p>

<p>A valuable bibliography is given in Gardner's "Handbook."

<h2><a name="HISTORICAL_DIRECTORY" id="HISTORICAL_DIRECTORY"></a>III. HISTORICAL DIRECTORY OF THE MARBLES REPRODUCED
IN THIS COLLECTION.</h2>

<p><i><a href="images/illus01.jpg">Frontispiece.</a></i> Terminal bust of Pericles, after an original
by Cresilas. Approximate date, 440-430 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> In
the British Museum, London.</p>

<p>1. <i><a href="images/illus02.jpg">Bust of Zeus Otricoli</a>.</i> Considered by Brunn and
others a copy from a head of the statue by Phidias.
Later critics do not agree with this opinion, and Furtwängler
calls the head a Praxitelean development of the
type of Zeus created in the time of Myron. Now in the
Vatican Gallery, Rome.</p>

<p>2. <a href="images/illus03.jpg"><i>Athena Giustiniana</i> (<i>Minerva Medica</i>)</a>. Considered
by Furtwängler a copy, after Euphranor, of a statue
dedicated below the Capitol, called Minerva Catuliana, set
up by A. Lutatius Catulus. The ægis and sphinx are
copyist's additions. Found in the gardens of the convent
of S. Maria sopra Minerva, Rome. Both arms are restored.
Now in the Vatican Gallery, Rome.</p>

<p>3. <i><a href="images/illus04.jpg">Horsemen from the Parthenon Frieze.</a></i> The frieze
of the Parthenon is part of the decorative scheme of the
marble temple of Athena, built during the age of Pericles
(480-430 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>) on the Acropolis, Athens, and decorated
under the direction of Phidias. The frieze consisted of a
series of panels or slabs, about 3 ft. 4 in. in height, and
was set on the outer wall of the cella. Being lighted from
below, the lower portion is cut in low relief (1&frac14; in.) and
the upper parts in high relief (2&frac14; in.). The panel of
the Horsemen is one of the Elgin Marbles, removed by
Lord Elgin from the Parthenon in 1801-1802, and now
in the British Museum, London.</p>

<p>4. <i><a href="images/illus05.jpg">Bust of Hera.</a></i> Considered by Murray a copy after
Polyclitus. Regarded by Furtwängler as a "Roman creation
based on a Praxitelean model." Catalogued in Hare's
"Walks in Rome" as a probable copy after Alcamenes.
In the Ludovisi Villa, Rome.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i><a href="images/illus06.jpg">The Apoxyomenos.</a></i>. A marble copy of the original
bronze statue by Lysippus, who flourished in the 4th century
B. C. According to Pliny the original was brought
from Greece to Rome by Agrippa to adorn the public
baths. This copy was found in 1849 in the Trastevere,
Rome, and is now in the Vatican Gallery.</p>

<p>6. <i><a href="images/illus07.jpg">Head of the Apollo Belvedere.</a></i> According to Gardner,
a marble copy (Roman) of a bronze original of the
Hellenistic Age (320-100 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>). Some (Winter and
Furtwängler) have assigned the original to Leochares, a
sculptor of the 4th century, and others to Calamis, in the
5th century. This copy was found in the 16th century at
Antium, and was purchased by Pope Julius II. for the
Belvedere Palace. Now in the Vatican Gallery, Rome.</p>

<p>7. <a href="images/illus08.jpg"><i>Demeter</i> (<i>Ceres</i>)</a> Considered by Furtwängler a
copy from an original by Agoracritus, who was a pupil
of Phidias, and whose works are closely allied to those of
Alcamenes. By the same authority the statue is called
the Nemesis. In the Vatican Gallery, Rome.</p>

<p>8. <a href="images/illus09.jpg"><i>The Faun of Praxiteles.</i></a> A copy of the original
statue by Praxiteles, which was in the street of the Tripods,
Athens. In the Capitol Museum, Rome.</p>

<p>9. <a href="images/illus10.jpg"><i>Sophocles.</i></a> Referred to by Collignon as a faithful
copy of the bronze statue raised by Lycurgus. Found at
Terracina in 1838, and now in the Lateran Museum,
Rome.</p>

<p>10. <a href="images/illus11.jpg"><i>Ares Seated.</i></a> Considered by Furtwängler and
others a copy on a reduced scale of a colossal statue by
Scopas. The little god Eros is the copyist's addition.
Found in the portico of Octavia, and restored by Bernini.
Now in the Ludovisi Villa, Rome.</p>

<p>11. <a href="images/illus12.jpg"><i>Head of the Olympian Hermes.</i></a> An undisputed
original work of Praxiteles, dating from the middle of the
4th century <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> It was in the Heræum (or Temple of
Hera) at Olympia, and was discovered by German excavators,
May 8, 1877. Now in the museum at Olympia,
Greece.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>12. <a href="images/illus13.jpg"><i>The Discobolus</i></a>, a copy from an original by Myron,
one of the last masters of the "severe style," whose career
culminated 465-450 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> In the Lancelotti Palace,
Rome.</p>

<p>13. <a href="images/illus14.jpg"><i>The Aphrodite of Melos</i> (<i>The Venus of Milo</i>).</a>
Formerly attributed to the period of transition between
Phidias and Praxiteles, but assigned by late critics to the
Hellenistic Age (320-100 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>). Believed by Furtwängler
to be based on a work by Scopas, with considerable
modification of the original. Found in 1820 on the island
of Melos at the entrance of the Greek Archipelago.

<h2>BUST OF ZEUS OTRICOLI</h2>

<p>From the earliest times men have sought to explain
in one way and another the common facts of daily
life. Sunrise and sunset, seedtime and harvest, life,
death, and the hereafter are some of the mysteries
which have always puzzled the human mind. The
primitive races, knowing nothing of science, looked
upon the forces of nature as gigantic personalities,
or gods, who controlled human destiny.</p>

<p>The most refined and imaginative of the ancient
nations were the Greeks. They invented innumerable
tales or myths, in which all the changes of nature
and all the affairs of life were attributed to the workings
of the gods. When the sun rose, they said
that Apollo had begun to drive his chariot across
the sky. When the wind blew, Zeus was sending
his messenger from the sky to the earth. When a
man did a courageous deed, it was because Athena
had whispered to him what to do.</p>

<p>In this way the beliefs gradually took form which
made the Greek religion. Great temples were built
for the worship of the gods, and statues were set up
in their honor. The finest works of Greek art were
connected with religious worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>The gods were conceived as having the same form
as human beings, but of colossal size. They lived
in an ideal country called Olympus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Here each god had a separate dwelling, and in
the midst was the palace of their supreme ruler,
Zeus, known to the Romans as Jupiter or Jove.</p>

<p>Zeus was the sky god, "the father of gods and
men," and the ruler of heaven and earth. He was
the "cloud compeller" at whose will the clouds gathered
or scattered across the sky, the "ruler of the
storms," the "thunderer," by whom were hurled the
ruddy lightnings. How far he surpassed all other
gods in power is explained in the Iliad in an address
made by Zeus himself to the gods:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the imagination of the Greeks Zeus was
endowed with all the noblest elements in human
character. He ruled the affairs of men with fatherly
benevolence. He rewarded goodness, punished the
wicked, and was withal the fountain-head of justice.
By a nod of his head he made known his will, and
there was no appeal from his decrees.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Greeks pictured this god as a being
of majestic stature and grand, benignant countenance,
and sculptors did their best to make statues
worthy of this conception. By common consent a
certain type of countenance was accepted as the
most fitting expression of this ideal. At last a
great artist named Phidias produced a statue which
perfectly carried out all the ideas at which other
sculptors had aimed. It was of colossal size, made
of gold and ivory, and was set up in a temple of
Olympia. From this time forth every sculptor who
had to represent Zeus had only to repeat the design
of Phidias.</p>

<p>Now we know that the farther an imitator gets
from the original standard, the weaker is his copy.
The first successors of Phidias made direct studies
from his statue, but those coming after worked from
copies. Still later artists took for their models copies
of these copies, until at last much of the original
grandeur of Phidias's conception was lost.</p>

<p>The bust of Zeus reproduced in our illustration is
thought to be a far-away copy of the head of Phidias's
statue. From the marble of which it is made
we know that it was executed in Italy, probably by
some Greek sculptor who had come thither after his
own nation had been conquered by Rome. The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>

marvel is that he preserved so well the noble dignity
of the ideal Zeus. This is the father of gods and
men in his most benign aspect. The massive head
is crowned like that of a lion with long, overhanging
locks with which the flowing beard is mingled.
These are the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Ambrosial curls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the Sovereign One's immortal head,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of which Homer writes in the Iliad. The symmetrical
arrangement of hair and beard carry out the character
of perfect evenness belonging to the supreme
ruler.</p>

<p>The forehead has the full bar of flesh which denotes
virility. The brows are straight, the nose
finely modeled, the lips rather full, the expression
benignant. Altogether the impression is of a being
of mental and moral equipoise, full of energy and
noble dignity.</p>

<h2>ATHENA GIUSTINIANA (MINERVA MEDICA)</h2>

<p>Athena was the air goddess of the Greeks, or, in
Ruskin's phrase, "the queen of the air." She was
known also by the name Pallas, and among the
Romans as Minerva. As the air comes to us from
out the great dome of the sky, so Athena was said
to have sprung fully armed from the head of her
father Zeus. The old Homeric hymn tells how</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>When arrayed for war she wore a golden helmet
and carried a shield, or <i>ægis</i>. In the centre of this
shield was fastened the gorgon's head which Perseus
had cut off with her aid. In her hand she wielded
a mighty spear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The owl was her symbolic bird, and she was called
<i>glaukopis</i>, or owl-eyed, because her wisdom gave her
sight in darkness. The serpent was the emblem of
her command over the beneficent and healing influences
in the earth. Her favorite plant was the fruitful
olive, valued by the Greeks both for the beauty
of its foliage and for the usefulness of its oil.</p>

<p>In the fortunes of war, when it was for defensive
aims, Athena took an intense interest and an active
part. In the war between the Greeks and the Trojans,
she was on the side of the Greeks, who sought
to recover from their enemies their queen Helen,
whom the Trojan prince had captured. When the

<p>To Athena Ulysses owed his safe return to Ithaca
after the adventures related in the Odyssey. It was
her adroit planning which brought together the long
lost father and his son Telemachus, with the faithful
wife Penelope. She also found ways to help Jason
when he went in search of the golden fleece; she
aided Hercules in his labors and guided the hand of
Perseus when he cut off the Gorgon's head.</p>

<p>Athena was also the patroness of the industrial
arts. She was skilful in weaving and needlework,
making both her own and others' beautiful robes and
teaching the craft to some favored mortals. She was,
in short, the personification of "inspired and impulsive
wisdom in human conduct and human art, giving
the instinct of infallible decision, and of faultless invention."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Finally, and not least important, Athena
was one of the agencies in the productiveness of the
earth, and hence the patron goddess of farmers.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> From Ruskin's <i>Queen of the Air</i>.</p></div>

<p>Our statue shows as many as possible of the attributes
of the goddess. The figure is tall and stately
and magnificently developed. The Greek ideal of
beauty was to let nature have its way in the human
body, unhindered by any such restraints of clothing
as our modern fashions have invented. The broad
shoulders and ample waist bespeak the splendid
strength of the goddess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p><p>

The neck rises from the shoulders like a column
to support the well-set head. A tunic falls in straight
folds to the feet, and over this is worn a long mantle
gathered over the left shoulder. Upon her breast
hangs the shield, here made very small, and the helmet
and spear complete her equipment as a goddess
of war. At her side coils the emblematic serpent.</p>

<p>Her aspect is far from warlike. The face is intellectual
and the expression thoughtful. This is the
goddess of wisdom reflecting upon grave concerns.
The mouth is set somewhat proudly, and the countenance
is full of a dignified reserve. The masterful
element, so strong in her character, is admirably expressed.
There is something almost austere in the
beauty of this virgin goddess. A majestic being like
this is not one to be familiarly approached.</p>

<h2>HORSEMEN FROM THE PARTHENON FRIEZE</h2>

<p>To understand the history and meaning of the bas-relief
reproduced in our illustration, we must first
learn something of the worship of Athena in her
chosen city of Athens. An annual festival was held
here in her honor, and every four years occurred a
very elaborate celebration called the Panathenæa.
The Panathenæa lasted several days, and attracted
throngs of people from all parts of Greece. There
were contests in gymnastics and music, torch-races,
horse-races, feasts and dances. Sacrifices of oxen
were offered on the altar of the goddess, every state
having to furnish an ox for the purpose. The
climax was reached on the last day, when a great
procession started at sunrise and traversed the streets
of the city to the temple of Athena. It is with this
procession that the bas-relief of our picture is connected,
as we shall presently see.</p>

<p>Some time before the festival a group of Athenian
maidens of the noblest families had made and embroidered
for Athena a beautiful robe called the
<i>peplos</i>. This was carried above the procession,
stretched like a sail on the mast of a ship which was
rolled through the street on wheels. The pageant
was made up of many different companies. There

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

were the Athenian magistrates, grave and dignified,
maidens carrying sacrificial vessels, men bearing trays
of cakes, citharists (harpists) and flute-players, old
men with olive branches, four-horse chariots with
armed warriors, rows of young men mounted on
prancing steeds, and attendants with the cattle for
the sacrifice.</p>

<p>During the invasion of Greece by the Persians,
the temple of Athena in Athens was destroyed by
fire. Later, on its site, was erected another to replace
it, called the Parthenon. The city was now
at the height of its prosperity under the statesman
Pericles. At this time also lived the great
sculptor Phidias, and to him Pericles intrusted the
decoration of the new temple.</p>

<p>The Parthenon was built of Pentelic marble, and
the temple proper was surrounded by a portico supported
on rows of columns. The outside of the
building was richly adorned with bas-reliefs. There
were designs in the triangular spaces under the roof
called <i>pediments</i>. Above the columns ran a series
of panels called <i>metopes</i>. Finally, there was a <i>frieze</i>
extending around the temple wall, to be seen from
within the portico. It is a bit of this frieze which
is reproduced in our illustration.</p>

The Panathenaic procession is the subject carried
the entire length of this bas-relief decoration. On
the portion running across one end were depicted the
scenes of preparation. Men are in the act of mounting
their horses, some having spirited animals to deal
with, and all making ready for the start. At the
opposite end is the scene of the arrival at the temple.
Here sit the gods to receive the sacrifice, while the
magistrates stand ready to perform the rites, and
maidens approach with the vessels. On the two long
sides the procession is seen actually in motion.
Here are represented all the figures which took
part in such occasions; old men and maidens, musicians,
horsemen, charioteers, and sacrificial animals,
all moving forward on their way. Group follows
group, with that contrast and variety which give interest
to a pageant, and with the proper orderliness
to give it unity.</p>

<p>Our panel shows us a line of horsemen riding four
abreast. Though it is broken and defaced, we catch
at once the spirit of the work. The horses are splendid
animals; with dilated nostrils, and necks proudly
arched, they seem to prance to the music of the
flutes. Though they are well matched in size and
type, no two are really alike. Every one has as distinct
a character as a human being, and lovers of
horses might choose each his own favorite from the
four.</p>

<p>Only two of the riders fall within our range of
vision. They are handsome youths, with the perfectly
formed head and finely cut profile which we
learn to recognize as the Greek ideal of beauty. The
line across forehead and nose is perfectly straight,
and the line connecting nose and chin forms a
corresponding angle. Both faces bear the stamp of
refinement and high breeding which mark them
as belonging to the class of Athenian nobles.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the two youths have so similar a cast of
countenance, they are quite unlike in temperament.
The farther one is of a somewhat dreamy, poetic
nature. He rides with bent head as if in a reverie.
His companion is of a sterner, more virile type. He
looks straight before him, and carries his head with
a sense of the dignity of the occasion.</p>

<p>Both youths sit their horses as if born in the saddle.
Horse and rider are one, animated by a single
dominant will. The Athenian youth were trained
from childhood in all sorts of manly exercise. The
normal development of the body was of first importance
in the Greek educational system. These young
men are typical examples of the fine specimens of
manhood which that training produced.</p>

<span class="i6">"The white armed queen,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>It is thus that the Iliad describes Hera, the wife
of Zeus, now more often called by her Roman name
Juno. The marriage union between the ruler of the
gods and his queen represented the Greek ideal of
perfect conjugal happiness. Hera was therefore the
goddess who presided over human marriages, and
was the type of matronly virtue and dignity. As
the queen of heaven, she had it in her power to
bestow great riches, honor, and influence upon her
favorites.</p>

<p>In the Trojan war she was, like Athena, a partisan
of the Greeks, and once or twice even accompanied
the war goddess to the battlefield. Usually,
however, her pursuits were of a more peaceful and
domestic order. She was a very beautiful goddess,
"ox-eyed" in the quaint Greek phrase, that is,
with large expressive eyes. She had the august and
majestic bearing befitting a queen, and is usually
described in classic literature as wearing a veil. A
long passage in the Iliad gives an account of her
toilet when arraying herself for a special occasion.
After bathing in ambrosia, and anointing with oil,

<p>One of the prettiest stories about Hera is that in
which she acted as the friend of Jason. Jason was
the son of a dethroned king and was brought up by
the centaur Chiron. When he came of age he set
forth, with much good advice from Chiron, to reclaim
his father's kingdom. On his journey he came
to a swollen stream which seemed well-nigh impassable.
As he was considering the danger of crossing
it, an old woman on the bank begged him to carry
her over. This was a hazardous undertaking, and
the young man was sorely tempted to refuse her.
At last his kindness triumphed and he consented.
Taking her on his back, he struggled across the river
at the peril of his life. When he set her safely on
the opposite bank, a wonderful thing happened.
"She grew fairer than all women, and taller than all
men on earth; and her garments shone like the
summer sea, and her jewels like the stars of heaven; and
over her forehead was a veil, woven of the golden
clouds of sunset, and through the veil she looked
down on him with great soft heifer's eyes; with

<p>The bust of Hera, reproduced in our illustration,
shows how the Greeks liked to think of their queen
goddess. We at once recognize the features assigned
to her by tradition; the large eyes set somewhat far
apart, the low, broad forehead, the mild expression.
The waving hair is parted, and gathered at the back
in a matronly coiffure, and over it is worn the crown
of a queen.</p>

<p>We have seen that in Greek sculpture the artist
was not always left to represent the divinities according
to his own imagination. For each one a certain
fixed type had been gradually thought out in very
early times, and this type was handed down from
generation to generation. A statue or bust could
always be recognized without any title. No one, for
instance, could ever mistake Zeus for Apollo, or
confuse Hera and Athena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>By comparing this head of Hera with that of
Athena in our previous illustration, we can see how
perfectly sculpture carried out the distinctions in the
two characters. Hera was less intellectual than
Athena, and had perhaps more distinctly feminine
charms. The mouth has less strength and firmness,
the expression more mildness. Her beauty is naturally
of a more matronly type than that of the virgin
goddess. The crown which she wears belongs as
distinctly to her as does the helmet to Athena.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the face suggests that it
may have been studied from actual life. If, as some
critics believe, the bust was made in Rome by some
Greek sojourning there after the conquest of his own
nation, a noble Roman matron may have been the
model. Be that as it may, this is Hera as the Greeks
worshipped her, and perhaps the best existing representation
of the great goddess.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<h2>THE APOXYOMENOS</h2>

<p>An important part of the Greek system of education
was the training of the body in physical exercise.
For this purpose there were gymnasia in every
city, where the youth were trained in running, leaping,
wrestling, throwing the javelin, and casting the
discus. Great spaces were occupied by these gymnasia,
which included buildings for dressing-rooms
and baths, porticoes and halls used as assembly-rooms,
walks, gardens, and the palæstra, or wrestling-field.</p>

<p>Every four years a great national festival was held
at Olympia, consisting of games or contests in the
various athletic sports. Every freeman of Hellenic
blood had a birthright to take part in them. The
contestants were required to undergo a preparatory
training, often lasting months, in the gymnasium of
Elis, the province in which Olympia was situated.</p>

<p>During the progress of the games a universal
truce was proclaimed throughout Greece. All hostilities
ceased for the time, and the Greeks as a
united people assembled at Olympia for the joyous
celebration in honor of Zeus. So important were
these Olympic games that they were used as a standard
for reckoning time. In assigning a date to an
event, the Greeks used to say that it took place in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

this or that Olympiad, an Olympiad being the period
of four years between two successive festivals.</p>

<p>We may well believe that the Olympic festivals,
as well as the ordinary daily exercise in the city
gymnasia, had great attractions for sculptors. The
palæstra must have been a favorite resort of artists.
What a sight it was when the young men came out
of the dressing-rooms stripped for running, their
bodies shining with oil,&mdash;what a play of muscles
in the lithe young limbs as the runners "pressed
toward the mark for the prize of the high calling!"
The course was usually of deep sand, and was about
three miles in length. The runners trained for
special emergencies attained extraordinary speed and
endurance. The race over, each youth returned to
the dressing-rooms of the gymnasium and, taking a
small instrument called the <i>strigil</i>, made of metal,
ivory, or horn, scraped the oil from his body.</p>

<p>It is in this cleansing process that the young man
of our illustration is engaged. The statue on this
account is called the Apoxyomenos, which is a Greek
word meaning "scraping himself." It represents a
typical incident of the life of the gymnasium, such
as might be seen any day of the year.</p>

<p>Tall and graceful, with slender flexible limbs, the
youth stands in an attitude of rest, scraping his
right arm. In his fingers is the die which marks
his number in the race. His body rests upon one
leg, but so light is his poise that he is ready to
change his position momentarily. Neither attitude
nor countenance shows any sense of exhaustion,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>

only that delicious fatigue which makes rest so enjoyable.</p>

<p>There is a passage in the Greek poet Aristophanes'
comedy of the Clouds, in which a speaker urges
upon a young man the life of the gymnasium.
"Fresh and fair in beauty-bloom," he says, "you
shall pass your days in the wrestling-ground, or run
races beneath the sacred olive trees, crowned with
white reed, in company with a pure-hearted friend,
smelling of bindweed, and leisure hours, and the
white poplar that sheds her leaves, rejoicing in the
prime of spring when the plane tree whispers to
the lime." This is the kind of life typified in the
figure of our statue,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> a side of Greek life which no
one can overlook if he would understand the genius
of the Greek nation.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The application
of this passage to the Apoxyomenos is made by J. A. Symonds in his <i>Greek Poets</i>.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>It must not be supposed that our statue represents
an actual individual. It is not a portrait, but an
imaginary typical figure. It is true that portrait
statues of athletes were made in great numbers, as
we shall note again in another chapter. It was indeed
this practical experience among athletes that
led sculptors to see what a perfect human figure
ought to be. In the study of many different forms
they developed an idea of a type common to all and
uniting all the perfections. Certain sculptors figured
out what they regarded as the true proportions
of the ideal human form. One of these was Lysippus,
who is believed to have executed this statue as
an illustration of his theories. We note as the
special characteristics of his ideal figure that it is
tall, with slim light limbs, and a rather small head,
about one eighth the total height.</p>

<p>We may now see how such a statue as the Apoxyomenos
was a preparatory study for statues of the
gods. The gods were to be represented in the most
perfect human forms which it was possible to conceive,
and by working out typical figures like this,
forms were found worthy of the noblest subjects.
Thus the proportions discovered by Lysippus were
peculiarly appropriate for the lighter, fleeter gods,
as Apollo and Hermes.</p>

<p>Lysippus executed his works entirely in bronze,
and the statue reproduced in our illustration is a
marble copy of the original, which was long since
lost.</p>

<h2>HEAD OF THE APOLLO BELVEDERE</h2>

<p>Ph&#339;bus Apollo was the Greek god of day, who
drove the great chariot of the sun across the sky
from dawn to sunset. As the sun's rays pierce the
air with darts of fire, so Apollo is an archer god
carrying a quiver full of arrows. The old Homeric
hymn calls him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Heaven's far darter, the fair king of days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom even the gods themselves fear when he goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Jove's high house; and when his goodly bows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He goes to bend, all from their thrones arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cluster near t' admire his faculties."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>

<p>If we count up all the gifts which the sunlight
brings us, we shall have a list of the offices of
Apollo. He brought the spring and the summer,
and ripened the grain for harvest. He warded off
disease and healed the sick. One of his earliest adventures
was to slay the serpent Python lurking in
the caves of Mt. Parnassus. Like the legend of St.
George and the Dragon, the story is an allegory of
the triumph of light over darkness, health over disease,
the power of good over the power of evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Apollo was also the patron of music, having received
from Hermes the gift of the lyre. He was
wont to play at the banquets of the gods, and the
poet Shelley describes his music in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And then Apollo with the plectrum strook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chords, and from beneath his hands a crash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mighty sounds rushed up, whose music shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul with sweetness, and like an adept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sweeter voice a just accordance kept."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> From Shelley's
translation of the Homeric <i>Hymn to Mercury</i>.</p></div>

<p>Poetry and the dance were also under Apollo's
protection, and he was the leader of the nine
muses.</p>

<p>His highest office was prophecy, and in all his
temples the priestesses gave mystic revelations of the
future. The most famous of these was at Delphi,
built over an opening in the ground, whence a strange
vapor rose. The priestess, a young woman called a
<i>pythia</i>, from the python slain by Apollo, sat over this
opening on a three-legged seat, or tripod, and answered
the questions brought to her. Her sayings
were in verses called <i>oracles</i>, supposed to be communicated
to her by the god.</p>

<p>Now, as might be expected, the character of
Apollo was as pure and transparent as the sunlight
itself. He required clean hands and pure hearts of
those who worshiped him. As the sunlight shines
into the dark places of the earth, driving the shadows
away, so Apollo hated all that was dark and evil in
human life. He was not only the rewarder of good
but the punisher of evil. In Shelley's "Hymn of
Apollo" these words are put in the god's mouth:&mdash;</p>

<p>The head of Apollo in our illustration is from a
famous full-length statue of the god known as the
Apollo Belvedere. The name Belvedere, which is
useful only to distinguish the statue from others of
the same subject, comes from the fact that the marble
once adorned a pavilion of the Vatican called the
Belvedere.</p>

<p>The god stands with left arm extended holding, it
is supposed, either a bow or a shield. A quiver of
arrows is slung across his back, and a chlamys, or
cloak, hangs over his left shoulder. His is the proud
attitude of one who is defending some sacred trust.
So he holds his head high and gazes steadily before
him as if watching an arrow speed to its mark, or
perhaps scanning the vanguard of an approaching
army. The expression is not a little haughty, and
one detects an almost disdainful curve of the lips as
if the god regarded the enemy with scorn. The face
is cut in an aristocratic mould, with fine sensitive
lines which mark the lover of music and poetry. In
fact, the refinement of his beauty has something of a
feminine quality.</p>

<p>The carefully curled hair is gathered in a bow
knot on the top of his head. It may indeed be
supposed that the handsome young god was by no
means unconscious of his charms, and took no little
pains to display them to good advantage.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The Apollo, however, is a god worthy of our admiration
for the noble purity of his countenance.
Surely, all base thoughts and mean motives would
be put to shame by this pure presence.</p>

<p>The poet Byron, whose "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage"
describes many interesting sights in Greece
and Italy, has written these lines about the Apollo
Belvedere:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The Lord of the unerring bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god of life, and poesy, and light&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All radiant from his triumph in the fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shaft hath just been shot&mdash;the arrow bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nostril beautiful disdain, and might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And majesty flash their full lightnings by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Developing in that one glance the deity."<br /></span></div></div>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h2>DEMETER (CERES)</h2>

<p>The Greeks worshipped among their deities a goddess
called Demeter, which means "mother earth."
It was her office to attend to the sowing and reaping
and all kinds of farm work. She first taught mankind
the use of the plough; she helped the men in
their threshing and the women in their baking. All
country folk sought her blessing in their labors. She
was, in fact, a personification of nature, and perhaps
it is a remnant of the old Greek belief in our speech
that we still refer to "mother earth" and "mother
nature."</p>

<p>Demeter's only child was a daughter, Persephone,
and upon her she lavished all a mother's fond devotion.
The story runs that one day Persephone was
gathering posies in the meadow when a strange accident
overtook her. A beautiful flower suddenly attracted
her attention, the like of which she had never
before seen. When she put forth her hand to pluck
it, the entire plant came up by the roots, leaving a
hole in the ground. The hole widened into a great
crack, the earth shook with a mighty thundering,
and out dashed a chariot drawn by coal-black steeds,
bearing Pluto, the king of the lower regions. He
caught up the astonished Persephone, and away they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>

sped again into the gloomy kingdom beyond the Styx,
where Persephone was installed as queen.</p>

<p>Demeter, missing her daughter, inquired everywhere
what had become of the maiden, but none
could tell her. Then she lighted a torch and began
a weary search for the lost child. Nine days she
wandered without finding any clew. But on the
tenth day she met the old witch Hecate, who had
heard Persephone scream when she was carried away.
Together the two sought Apollo, who sees all the
doings of gods and men, and he told them the whole
story. "Then a more terrible grief took possession
of Demeter, and ... she forsook the assembly of
the gods and abode among men for a long time, veiling
her beauty under a worn countenance so that
none who looked upon her knew her." She declared
that the earth should not again bring forth fruit till
she had seen her daughter.</p>

<p>It comforted her not a little in this time of mourning
to take a mother's care of a certain sickly little
child she chanced upon. Disguised as a nurse, she
fed the child upon ambrosia, held him in her bosom,
and at night covered him in a bed of coals. Under
this treatment he thrived amazingly; but the parents
discovered the nurse's strange ways and became
alarmed. Their anxiety was turned to dismay when
they learned that this was a goddess, who would
have made their son immortal but for their interference.</p>

<p>In the mean time the crops fell into a bad state,
and it was a year of grievous famine. Demeter still
kept her vow to let no green thing appear upon the
earth. Then Zeus came to the rescue of perishing
humanity. He sent a messenger to Pluto begging
him to let Persephone return to her mother. The
request was granted, the chariot was made ready,
but the wily king first pressed his bride to eat with
him some pomegranate seeds, designing that she
should return to him again. Mother and daughter
were now joyfully reunited, but not without further
separation; for a portion of each year Persephone
returned to her kingdom below the earth, reappearing
in the spring to visit her mother. And this is
why to this day the harvest is followed by winter
until the spring revisits the earth.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>

The story of Demeter and Persephone is related in the Homeric
<i>Hymn to Demeter</i>, of which an abridged English version is given in the
chapter on the Myth of Demeter and Persephone in Pater's <i>Greek
Studies</i>. The same chapter refers to various other ancient forms of
the story, one of the most important being that of Ovid's Metamorphoses,
translated into English blank verse by Edward King.</p></div>

<p>In all this story we see that the most striking characteristic
of Demeter is her motherliness. In some
respects she is like Hera, because both are matrons
and are patterns of the domestic virtues. But while
Hera is the model wife, Demeter is the model mother.</p>

<p>It is the motherliness of our statue which makes us feel sure that it
must be intended to represent Demeter.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>The goddess stands holding
in her outstretched right hand a sheaf of wheat, and lifting high in the
left hand the torch with which she journeyed round the world. It is as
if she stood on the threshold of the opening season awaiting her
daughter's return. She gazes straight before her with a look of
expectancy as if she already saw her child from afar. Her face is
lighted by a smile of welcome. One can fancy how tenderly those motherly
arms will fold the child to her heart, and how gladly the daughter will
pillow her head on that broad bosom.</p>

statue.

<p>The figure is in striking contrast to the statue of
Athena which we have studied. The virgin goddess
is stately and unapproachable in her panoply of wisdom,
but the great mother seems to invite our confidence.
She is one to whom a frightened child
might run, sure of being soothed. To her the sorrowing
would turn, fearing no repulse. She would
welcome, she would understand, she would comfort.
There is strength and repose in every line of her
majestic figure.</p>

<p>The statue illustrates admirably the grandeur and
simplicity of the best Greek art. The long straight
lines of the drapery, unbroken by any unnecessary
folds, are the secret of the impression of tranquil
dignity in the work.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h2>THE FAUN OF PRAXITELES</h2>

<p>The imagination of the Greeks peopled the woods
and waters with all sorts of mythical beings, among
which one of the most delightful was the faun.
This was a creature half human, half animal, which
frolicked in the woods in spring time. In outward
appearance it looked much like a human being, except
that it had pointed furry ears. In nature, however,
it was closely akin to the animals, and lived a free
happy life, with none of the thoughts and cares
which beset the soul of man.</p>

<p>Our statue represents a sculptor's conception of
this sportive being. It is famous not only because it
is a celebrated work of art, but because it takes an
important place in a celebrated novel. This is the
"marble faun" which gives the title to Hawthorne's
book. It will be remembered that in the beginning
of the story, a party of friends are visiting the museum
of the Capitol in Rome, where the statue stands.
Suddenly they notice the resemblance which one of
their number, a young Italian named Donatello,
bears to the statue. They bid him take the same
attitude, and the likeness is complete. The writer
describes the statue in these words: "The Faun is
the marble image of a young man leaning his right

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>

arm on the trunk or stump of a tree; one hand
hangs carelessly by his side; in the other he holds
the fragment of a pipe, or some such sylvan instrument
of music. His only garment&mdash;a lion's skin,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
with the claws upon his shoulder&mdash;falls halfway
down his back, leaving the limbs and entire front
of the figure nude. The form, thus displayed, is
marvellously graceful, but has a fuller and more
rounded outline, more flesh, and less of heroic muscle,
than the old sculptors were wont to assign to their
types of masculine beauty.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The character of the
face corresponds with the figure; it is most agreeable
in outline and feature, but rounded and somewhat
voluptuously developed, especially about the
throat and chin; the nose is almost straight, but very
slightly curves inward, thereby acquiring an indescribable
charm of geniality and humor. The mouth,
with its full yet delicate lips, seems so nearly to
smile outright that it calls forth a responsive smile.
The whole statue&mdash;unlike anything else that ever
was wrought in that severe material of marble&mdash;conveys
the idea of an amiable and sensual creature,
easy, mirthful, apt for jollity, yet not incapable
of being touched by pathos. It is impossible to gaze
long at this stone image without conceiving a kindly
sentiment towards it, as if its substance were warm
to the touch, and imbued with actual life. It comes
very close to some of our pleasantest sympathies."</p>

<p>After this description the writer goes on to analyze the nature of the Faun.
"The being here represented,"
he says, "is endowed with no principle
of virtue, and would be incapable of comprehending
such; but he would be true and honest by dint of
his simplicity. We should expect from him no sacrifice
or effort for an abstract cause; there is not an
atom of martyr's stuff in all that softened marble;
but he has a capacity for strong and warm attachment,
and might act devotedly through its impulse,
and even die for it at need. It is possible, too, that
the Faun might be educated through the medium
of his emotions, so that the coarser animal portion of
his nature might eventually be thrown into the background,
though never utterly expelled."</p>

<p>The original statue, of which the marble of the
Capitol is a copy, was the work of the sculptor
Praxiteles. As Hawthorne says: "Only a sculptor
of the finest imagination, the most delicate taste,
the sweetest feeling, and the rarest artistic skill&mdash;in
a word, a sculptor and a poet too&mdash;could have ... succeeded
in imprisoning the sportive and frisky
thing in marble." We are presently to see again in
the head of Hermes that Praxiteles was indeed a remarkable
sculptor. The Faun, however, is the more
difficult subject of the two, for it was puzzling to
think what expression would be proper to a being
partly human, but without a soul.</p>

<p>It is said that Praxiteles himself considered the
Faun one of his two best works. It had been impossible
for his friends to get an expression of opinion
from him in regard to his statues, until one day

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>

a trick was devised to betray him. He was told that
his studio was on fire, when he exclaimed that his
labor was all lost if the Faun and the Eros were destroyed.</p>

<p>The Faun originally stood in the street of the
Tripods at Athens, but what has now become of it we
do not know. The statue in our illustration is one
of the most celebrated copies. Many travellers make
a special pilgrimage to see it, and seeing it recall the
words of Hawthorne, describing the spell it casts
upon the spectator. "All the pleasantness of sylvan
life, all the genial and happy characteristics of creatures
that dwell in woods and fields, will seem to be
mingled and kneaded into one substance, along with
the kindred qualities in the human soul. Trees,
grass, flowers, woodland streamlets, cattle, deer, and
unsophisticated man&mdash;the essence of all these was
compressed long ago, and still exists, within that discolored
marble surface of the Faun of Praxiteles."</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<h2>SOPHOCLES</h2>

<p>One of the greatest of Greek writers was the
tragic poet Sophocles. He was born near Athens
in the year 495 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, and was educated after the
manner of the Greek youth of his time. Every advantage
was given him for the study of music and
poetry, and also for that gymnastic training which,
as we have seen, was so important in Greek education.</p>

<p>Sophocles was a handsome youth, and acquitted
himself well in the palæstra. When he was sixteen
years of age the great battle of Salamis was fought
and won by the Greeks. In the celebration of this
victory at Athens, Sophocles led with dance and lyre
the chorus of young men who sang the pæan or
hymn of victory. That such an honor should be
given him shows how graceful and gifted he must
have been.</p>

<p>The beginning of his literary career came when he
was in his twenty-fifth year. At that time a solemn
festival was held in Athens in memory of the ancient
King Theseus, whose bones had been brought
thither from the island of Scyros. Now all religious
festivals in Greece were celebrated with contests,
some athletic, others artistic and literary. On this
occasion there was a contest of dramatic poets.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>

Æschylus was at that time the greatest of living
tragedians, and as he was among the contestants, it
might have been supposed that no other candidate
could have succeeded. Sophocles now came forward
with his first tragedy, and so remarkable was it
found to be that the judges pronounced him victor.</p>

<p>From this time forth Sophocles continually grew
in dramatic and literary power. Twenty times he
obtained the first prize in other contests, and many
times also the second prize. The amount of his work
was prodigious. Most of his dramas are lost, but we
still have a half dozen or more to show us the noble
quality of his work. The finest are perhaps those
called &#338;dipus Tyrannus, &#338;dipus Coloneus, and
Antigone, all dealing with the tragic fate of an
ancient royal family.</p>

<p>Athens was justly proud of her great poet and
bestowed various honors upon him. He was even
made a general, and served in the war against Samos;
but nature had made him a poet, and it is as a poet
that we must always think of him. Full of years
and honors, he died in Athens at the age of ninety.
Of him the Greek poet Phrynicus wrote,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thrice happy Sophocles! in good old age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed as a man, and as a craftsman blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He died: his many tragedies were fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair his end, nor knew he any sorrow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our portrait shows admirably what manner of
man he was, handsome and dignified, in the prime
of life.</p>

<p>The scanty folds of his toga reveal the fine lines of
his graceful figure. The pose shows the bodily vigor
which his early athletic training gave him. He holds
his head erect in a manner suggestive of his military
life. The face is that of an idealist and a poet, a
man who sees splendid visions. Yet it is not altogether
dreamy in the ordinary sense; it has the alert,
energetic aspect of one who would turn from vision
to action. It is not hard to believe the tale of his
one hundred and twenty-three dramas: such a man
would fill his life with activity. The face has, too,
the expression of genial kindliness which made the
great poet so beloved of his fellow men. His must
have been that calm, equable temperament not easily
ruffled, which goes with the self-respecting nature.
A receptacle at his side is filled with the scrolls of
his tragedies. He stands in the attitude of a poet
reciting his lines to an assembled audience.</p>

<p>The statue shows how sane was the Greek ideal of
intellectual greatness. In those days genius did not
mean eccentricity, but the rule of life was a sound
mind in a sound body. It is a mistaken notion of
our own times that bodily health must be sacrificed
to the training of the brain. It is even supposed
by some that oddities of dress and manner are signs
of greatness.</p>

<p>The Greeks had no such delusions. Here is
Sophocles, the greatest dramatic poet of antiquity,
a magnificent specimen of symmetrically developed
manhood. He is a man who has made the most of
life's opportunities as he understood them. He enjoys
perfect bodily vigor; he is as well a man of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>

world, at ease among men. There is evidently nothing
of the recluse in his character. He wears his
beard carefully trimmed as one who looks well to his
personal appearance. Yet intellectual greatness is
stamped on face and bearing: the noble countenance
marks him as a poet.</p>

<p>There was a period in Greek history when it was
a custom to adorn public buildings with statues of
famous men, living or dead. Libraries were appropriately
decorated with statues of poets, and we
fancy that our statue of Sophocles was made for
such a purpose. The original is supposed to have
been set up by a certain Athenian statesman named
Lycurgus in the fourth century <span class="smcap">B. C.</span></p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>

<h2>ARES SEATED</h2>

<p>Old soldiers tell us that sometimes in the thick of
a battle men fight as though possessed by a spirit of
fury. The excitement of the conflict seems to arouse
an impulse of bloodthirstiness in them, and for the
moment they seem to exult in the carnage. In the
ancient methods of warfare, when a battle was literally
a hand-to-hand conflict, this spirit of brutality
was of course even more marked. In the wars
among the early Greeks men fell upon one another
with the violence of wild animals.</p>

<p>The Greeks with their ready gift for personification
conceived of this spirit of warfare as a supernatural
being acting on human lives. He was called
Ares, the god whose special delight was to incite the
fierce passions of men.</p>

<p>It was natural that the Greeks should refer his
influence chiefly to their enemies. On their own part
they preferred to think that their armies were inspired
by the prudent spirit of self-defense embodied
in Athena. This explains why in the Iliad Ares was
on the side of the Trojans, while Athena aided the
Greeks. Thus Ares and Athena were brought into
direct rivalry, the spirit of violence against the spirit
of strategy.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>An instance is related when Athena makes an appeal
to her enemy, the translation running in these
words, the Roman name Mars being used for Ares.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mars, Mars, thou slayer of men, thou steeped in blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destroyer of walled cities! should we not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave both the Greeks and Trojans to contend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jove to crown with glory whom he will,<br /></span>

<a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Iliad, Book v., lines 33-37.</p></div>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, both deities continued
to aid their favorites. Mars was forced to yield
before the skill and prudence of Athena. Guided
by the goddess the Greek hero Diomed wounds and
drives him from the battle.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a>

<p>In spite of his violent nature Mars was a handsome
god, "stately, swift, unwearied, puissant."
Though war was his chief delight he was quite susceptible
to the tender passion. Venus was the object
of his devotion, and the goddess of love returned
the war god's admiration. It was she who soothed
his wounded vanity when Athena mocked him in
the presence of the gods and struck him to earth
with a stone.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a>

<p>The statue reproduced in our illustration shows
the god in his mildest aspect. He is seated in a meditative
attitude, clasping his hands over his upraised
knee. His splendidly developed body is relaxed in
a posture of repose, the shield is laid aside for a
moment, and he rests from his labors. In the best
period of Greek sculpture it was entirely contrary
to the laws of taste to represent Ares in any warlike
action. The gods must always be portrayed
in a dignified repose befitting their superiority to
mankind. Not then in his attitude or expression do
we find any sign of the character of the god. There
is no suggestion of unrest in his quiet posture.</p>

<p>The shape of his head perhaps gives some hint
of his combative nature. The cast of countenance,
too, shows an impulsive temper, weak in intellectual
qualities, and quick to anger. Yet he is undeniably
attractive, with his well-chiseled features and clustering
curls. The small ear is as delicately cut as a
woman's. The fine athletic figure is such as any
warrior might covet; muscular and supple, it is full
of power even in repose. The attitude of easy grace
displays its best points to advantage.</p>

<p>Sitting on the ground in front of the god is the
figure of a mischievous baby boy. This is the little
god Eros, who in Greek mythology was supposed to
be the inspirer of love. The artist meant to suggest
that the subject of Ares' meditations might be
some affair of the heart. Certainly his mild smile
would carry out that interpretation. Some critics
have thought, however, that the statue did not originally
include the child.</p>

<p>As we study the modelling of the figure, the free
sweep of the long lines delights the eye. We shall
come to understand from repeated examples that the
best Greek sculptors thoroughly mastered the secret
of fine lines. Our illustration is somewhat unusual
because the figure is seated. Even in this position,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>

however, the sculptor gives us a sense of the perfect
grace and lightness of the pose. There is nothing
heavy or immovable in the attitude. We can easily
imagine how the god, rising lightly to his feet,
would stand erect and beautiful, ready for action.</p>

<h2>HEAD OF THE OLYMPIAN HERMES</h2>

<p>To do his errands and carry his messages through
the universe the supreme god Zeus had a herald,
Hermes, the god of the wind. As the wind blows
out of the great sky, so Hermes descended from
Olympus to earth to do the sky god's bidding.
Equipped as a herald he wore a winged cap and
winged sandals, which carried him about with great
speed. He had also a short sword bent like a scythe,
given him by Zeus with the cap and sandals. He
possessed the strange power of making himself invisible,
and of assuming different forms. As he had
besides a ready wit and an eloquent tongue, he could
make himself very useful. It was one of his common
tasks to carry sleep to mortals, and his most
solemn office was to conduct the souls of the dying
to the other world.</p>

<p>This is the way the Odyssey describes Hermes setting
forth on one of the errands of Zeus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"The herald Argicide obeyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hastily beneath his feet he bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair ambrosial golden sandals, worn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear him over ocean like the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the boundless land. His wand he took,<br /></span>

<p>One of the most famous adventures of Hermes
was the slaying of the many-eyed monster Argus,
from whom he rescued the unhappy Io. This is why
the old Greek poet, whom we have quoted, calls the
god the Argicide. Another of his well known missions
was the care of the motherless infant Bacchus,
whom he conveyed to the nymphs of Nysa to be
reared. An adventurer himself, Hermes was ever
ready to aid heroes in their exploits. It was with
his sword that Perseus cut off the Gorgon's head:
we may read the story in Hawthorne's "Wonder-Book"
and Kingsley's "Greek Heroes."</p>

<p>Nor was Hermes above a bit of mischief now and
then. An old Homeric hymn tells of a sly prank
he played upon Apollo, when he was a mere baby,
stealing the herds of Admetus which Apollo was
keeping. He was an ingenious fellow too, and this
is how he invented the lyre. Taking from the
beach a tortoise, he cleaned out the shell, pierced it
with holes, and stretched from hole to hole, at regular
intervals, cords of sheep gut.</p>

<p>With this instrument Apollo was so delighted
that Hermes straightway presented it to him, to
make some amends, as it were, for the injury done
him. In return Apollo bestowed the <i>caduceus</i>, or
wand, upon Hermes, and the two gods vowed eternal
friendship.</p>

<p>The Greeks were very fond of their god Hermes.
He was not too grand to be companionable, like the
awe-inspiring Zeus or the haughty Apollo. They
thought of him as a blithe, gentle being whose lighthearted
ways and easy good nature made him a general
favorite. It was an early custom to set up in
his honor stone posts at the crossroads. Sometimes
they were topped by the heads of other gods, but
these were called for him, <i>hermæ</i>. In the course of
time better statues were made in full length figure.
The head reproduced in our illustration is from such
an one which used to stand in a temple of Olympia,
from the ruins of which it was unearthed a few years
ago.</p>

<p>The entire right arm and parts of both legs are
missing, but the other portions of the statue show
the god's position. He is leaning against a tree
trunk, holding on his left arm the infant Bacchus,
who was, as we have seen, consigned to his care by
Zeus. Hermes is not, however, looking at the child,
but gazes dreamily before him, his head bent in the
pensive pose which we see. The features are cut
with typical Greek regularity, but the countenance
has besides its own individual charm. The droop of
the upper eyelid suggests a dreamy nature, and in
the curve of the smiling lips is a hint of playfulness.
The lower forehead is full, showing over the eyes
the bar of flesh which marks the strongly masculine
nature. The closely cropped curls preserve the perfect

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

contour of the head. The small, beautiful ear
is as daintily modeled as the ringlets of hair.</p>

<p>The face wins us at once with its gentle amiability.
It is tender and playful, and withal exquisitely refined
and courteous. What a deferential listener is suggested
in that pose of the head! The pure outline
of the face calls to mind those knights of chivalry
who gathered about King Arthur's Round Table,
and one wonders if Sir Galahad himself might not
have looked like this.</p>

<p>This statue is the work of the great sculptor
Praxiteles, and is the only original marble in existence
direct from his hands. All the rest of his work
is known from descriptions and copies. We can
understand, then, how sculptors and critics the world
over have examined it to study the sculptor's methods.
It is of Parian marble, much stained with iron
rust from its long entombment under the soil.</p>

<h2>THE DISCOBOLUS (THE DISK-THROWER)</h2>


<p>We have seen how important a part in the Greek
national life was occupied by the Olympic Games.
They were regarded as a sacred institution of the
gods, and to contend in them was a religious consecration.
None could enter them who had been
guilty of dishonorable conduct or sacrilege, and
young men from the noblest families were not above
taking part. The prizes were wreaths of wild parsley,
olive, and pine, having no intrinsic worth,
but of priceless value to the recipients. To win
them was the highest ambition of many a Greek
youth.</p>

<p>The victor was led forth before the people, crowned
with the wreath and bearing a palm branch in his
hand. Heralds proclaimed his name and that of
his father. Banquets were spread in his honor, and
songs were composed in his praise.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> From thenceforth
he was a person of distinction. Finally his
statue was set up in the <i>altis</i> or sacred grove of
Olympia. There were at one time as many as three
thousand such statues in the place.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> See, for \

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p></div>

<p>It will be readily seen that in statues of athletes the
sculptor had greater freedom than in statues of the
gods. The latter must be represented in dignified
attitudes of repose, but the former would naturally
be portrayed in some characteristic posture of action.
It is so with the statue in our illustration called the
Discobolus or Disk-thrower.</p>

<p>The game of disk-throwing was very old, so old
that there were Greek legends of famous games
played by the gods and heroes. Apollo sometimes
tried his hand at it, and also Perseus. The discus,
or disk, was a heavy round plate of metal, bronze or
iron, about eight inches in diameter, grasped in one
hand, swung around to give it a rotary motion, and
then sent flying through the air. A modern authority
explains that it was thrown not as the quoit is to-day,
with arm and shoulder only, but by bringing
into play and utilizing every limb and muscle of the
body. "Immediately preceding the actual hurling
of the discus, therefore, there had to be a general
storing up and compression of energy which, when
suddenly set free, produced the violence of the projection.
The principle is simply that of the spring
which, when compressed, shoots out from the centre.
The greater the contortion of the body, the more
each muscle and sinew is strung towards one centre,
the greater will be the impetus when this compression
is suddenly set free."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a>

<p>Our statue shows the disk-thrower at the moment
immediately preceding the throw. As described by
the ancient writer Lucian, "he is bent down into
the position for the throw, turning towards the hand
that holds the disk, and all but bending on one
knee, he seems as if he would straighten himself up
at the throw."</p>

<p>The modern critic whom we have already quoted
shows that when we view the statue from the front,
"all the lines of the modelling indicate the tension
of the sinews towards the contracted centre of the
body, and the legs, neck, and shoulders tend towards
the same point." When we walk around the
statue, all the lines in the back and sides "seem to
lead towards that central point like the spiral contraction
of a spring." It is by thus suggesting the
concentration of energy on the part of the Discobolus
that the figure appears so full of life and
action.</p>

<p>By the choice of this posture the artist was enabled
to model his figure on magnificent sculpturesque
lines. One long fine curve sweeps along the right
arm, is continued down the left arm, and is carried
to completion in the left leg and foot. The counter
curve starts under the right shoulder, and sweeps
down the right side and leg.</p>

<p>The original statue of the Discobolus was executed
in bronze, and our reproduction is from one of several
ancient copies in marble. In some of these the original
head of the statue has been replaced by another,
but the copy we see here has a fine, vigorous head.
The English critic, Walter Pater,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> describes the face
"as smooth but spare, and tightly drawn over muscle
and bone." He shows too how sympathetic the face
is with the whole intention of the statue, "as the
source of will."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a>

<a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> This opinion

<p>The sculptor of the Discobolus was Myron, who
lived in the period between the Persian War and the
middle of the fifth century. His work shows his
fondness for movement, though many of his subjects
did not permit him to indulge his taste. He
made a specialty of figures of athletes, both commemorative
portrait statues and typical figures. We
do not know whether this statue represents an actual
Olympic victor, or is a typical figure, like the Apoxyomenos.
In any case it gives an excellent idea
of the great influence exercised upon Greek life by
the athletic games.</p>

<h2>THE APHRODITE OF MELOS (VENUS OF MILO)</h2>

<p>By Greek tradition the fairest of the goddesses
was Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. To
her every lover paid his vows and every maiden
prayed for charms. An old legend relates that she
was born from the foam of the sea, hence the name
Aphrodite, which means "foam-born." Among the
Romans she was called Venus. At her birth the
island of Cyprus received her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Where the force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gentle-breathing Zephyr steer'd her course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the waves of the resounding sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet unborn in that soft foam she lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brought her forth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here she emerged "a goddess in the charms of
awful beauty." The Hours welcomed her eagerly,
taking her in their arms and putting a crown of gold
upon her head. As she went on her way, flowers
grew in her path,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Where her delicate feet<br /></span>

<a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> An account
of the birth of Aphrodite is given in Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i> and in
the Homeric <i>Hymn to Venus</i>, and the quotations here are drawn from
both sources.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>As we have already seen, there were among the
Greek divinities two other goddesses besides Aphrodite
specially famed for their beauty,&mdash;Athena and
Hera. Tradition tells how the beauty of the three
was tested. An apple was thrown into their midst
inscribed "For the fairest," and a contention at once
arose as to the rightful owner. Paris, the prince of
Troy, being chosen arbiter, decided in favor of Aphrodite,
who promised him for a wife the fairest woman
in Greece, that is, Helen.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This was the real
cause of the Trojan War, in which the Greeks sought
to recover their stolen princess. Aphrodite being at
the bottom of the trouble remained through the war
on the Trojan side.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> See Tennyson's
poem, <i>Oenone</i>.</p></div>

<p>Oddly enough the beautiful goddess was mated
to the ugliest of the gods, the lame blacksmith Hephæstus
(or Vulcan). At his forge were made those
fateful arrows of the little god Eros (or Cupid), the
mother standing by to tip their points with honey.</p>

<p>The power of love in human life made the ideal
of Aphrodite very dear to the hearts of the Greeks.
All that is most tender and sacred in this human relation
was personified in her. As love ennobles the
life and makes it unselfish, so, they reasoned, must
Aphrodite be a grand and noble being. Again, as
love glorifies the life, and brings joy into its commonest
details, she must also be beautiful and laughter-loving.
In short, one cannot think of any quality
of love which was not reflected in the person
of the glorious goddess. Temples were built in her
honor, and she was worshiped in festivals and sacrificial
rites. Statues of her were set up in many
places, and one of the most famous which has come
down to us is reproduced in our illustration.</p>

<p>We have now learned by repeated instances that
the Greeks had such definite ideas of their deities
that their statues were as readily recognized as if
they represented actual persons. The sculptors followed
types accepted by tradition as the best embodiment
of the characters they stood for. So especially
with Zeus, Athena, and Hera, and so again with
Aphrodite. She must be supremely fair, with a
beauty less austere than that of the maiden Athena,
less regal than that of Hera, and more fascinating
than either.</p>

<p>We see then at once that the beautiful figure of our
illustration must be Aphrodite, or Venus. In looking
at her we think, not of wisdom, or force, or power,
but just of beauty. She stands resting the weight
of her body on one foot, and advancing the other
with knee bent. The posture causes the figure to
sway slightly to one side, describing a fine curved
line. The lower limbs are draped, but the upper
part of the body is uncovered, and in some mysterious
way the sculptor has imparted to the marble a
seeming softness as of real flesh. The head is as
exquisitely set as a flower on its stalk. The parted
hair is drawn back in rippling waves over the low
forehead.</p>

<p>The eyes are not very wide open, having something
of a dreamy languor. "Melting eyes" are indeed
characteristic of Venus, and an analytical critic has
explained that this effect is produced in sculpture by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>

a "slight elevation of the inner corner of the lower
eyelid." The nose is perfectly cut, the mouth and
chin are moulded in adorable curves. Yet to say
that every feature is of faultless perfection is but
cold praise. No analysis can convey the sense of
her peerless beauty.</p>

<p>The statue originally stood on the Greek island of
Melos, where it was discovered in 1820 in this broken
state. Many wise heads have been puzzled to know
the position of the missing arms. Some have thought
that the goddess carried a shield, and others have
fancied her holding the traditional apple. There
have also been many discussions as to the date of the
work. Now if the statue had been made in the fifth
century <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, the goddess would have been fully
draped; if in the fourth century, entirely without
drapery. Our sculptor then belonged to neither of
these periods, and combined the characteristics of
both. It is a fault on his part to have placed the
drapery in an impossible position, whence in actual
life it would immediately fall of its own weight.
Yet we do not think of such criticisms when we see
it. The beautiful body rising above the drapery reminds
us of the myth of Aphrodite emerging from
the sea foam. Her beauty is a union of strength
and sweetness, a perfect embodiment of a nature at
harmony with itself and its surroundings.</p>

<h2>ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE</h2>

<p>There was once a man named Orpheus, who lived
in the land of Thrace. It was said that his father
was Apollo, and his mother the muse Calliope; so it
is not strange that he was both poet and musician.
So enchanting was the music of his lyre that wild
animals came forth from their haunts to hear him.
Even trees and rocks seemed to feel the magic influence
of the strain.</p>

<p>He had a beautiful wife named Eurydice, whom he
loved dearly, and they were happy together till a sad
accident separated them. She was bitten one day
by a poisonous serpent, and died from the effects of
the wound. There was no more happiness on earth
for Orpheus, and he determined to seek Eurydice in
the underworld of the dead.</p>

<p>Now the gates of the lower regions were guarded
by a three-headed dog named Cerberus, but even this
fierce beast was subdued by the entrancing music of
Orpheus, who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Through the unsubstantial realm<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of shadows throned&mdash;and struck his lyre, and sang."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Pouring forth the mournful tale of his lost love,
he appealed to the gods to give him back Eurydice.
So eloquent was his plea that all who listened were
"moved to weeping." Then for the first time the
iron cheeks of the Furies were wet with tears, and</p>

</div></div>

<p>Eurydice was brought forth and restored to her
husband, but a single condition was laid upon Orpheus
in leading her out. Until they had regained
the earth he was not to look backward, or the boon
would be forfeited. The Latin poet Ovid tells how
the two fared forth together from the underworld,
and how Orpheus failed in the conditions of the
agreement.</p>

<p>Our bas-relief represents a scene of parting between
Orpheus and Eurydice, and we may take it, as we
please, to refer to their first or to their last farewell.
It seems, however, to apply more appropriately
to the first departure of Eurydice to the unknown
land. She lays her hand fondly upon her husband's
shoulder, and he touches it gently as if to detain
her.</p>

<p>The figure on the other side is the messenger god
Hermes, whose mission is to conduct departing spirits
to the other world.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He has come for Eurydice,
and he takes her by the hand to draw her away.
For a moment husband and wife gaze into each
other's eyes with love and sorrow, while the messenger
waits with exquisite courtesy.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> See <a href="#Page_61">page 61</a>.</p></div>

<p>Though the Greeks had many tales of sorrow in
their poetry and mythology, they did not often illustrate
them in their art. The subjects of their sculpture
are nearly always happy ones. Even here, you
see, grief is made so beautiful and dignified that we
forget to feel sad about the parting. We think most
of the love and devotion between Orpheus and Eurydice.</p>

<p>The simple story of the bas-relief touches us more
readily perhaps than the grand statues of the gods.
People like in art something which corresponds to
the common human lives of all.</p>

<p>The garment worn by Eurydice seems quite like
that of the goddess Demeter. The drapery is very
full in front, falling in long straight folds. At the
side it is scantier and shows the motion of the figure
in walking. The short tunic worn by the other figures
is a picturesque costume, and the mantle swinging
over one shoulder is very graceful. When one
contrasts with these classical draperies the stiff dress
of modern times, one wonders that the sculptor of
to-day does not throw down his chisel in despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The style of the draperies often enables a critic to
decide in what period a work of art was produced.
In the best art the folds are always simple: it is a
sure sign of declining art when the folds are complicated
and broken. Here we see the few simple,
severe lines which mark the purest classical taste.</p>

<h2>NIKE (THE WINGED VICTORY)</h2>

<p>Upon the death of Alexander the Great there was
much disputing among his generals as to what
should become of the various provinces of his empire,
including Greece. It was finally decided that the
Greek cities should be left free. A general named
Ptolemy soon broke this agreement and entered
Greece, whereupon another named Antigonus
promptly proceeded to punish him. Antigonus had
a son Demetrius, who was a skilful engineer, and
was called Poliorcetes, "besieger of cities," for his
success in raising sieges. He was sent to Athens
with a fleet of two hundred and fifty ships, and won
the gratitude of the city for delivering it from the
hands of Ptolemy. Demetrius next turned his
attention to the island of Cyprus, of which Ptolemy
was in possession. The rival forces met off Salamis,
306 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, in a fierce sea fight, and Demetrius was
victorious.</p>

<p>Now the Greeks were fond of commemorating
notable events by the erection of statues, and it was
an old custom among them to set up a statue of
victory in honor of any success of arms on land or
sea. We have seen how natural it was for them
to attribute the affairs of life to the agency of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>

deities. So in war, greatly as they praised their
armies and their generals, it was to Nike, the goddess
of victory, that they gave the chief credit of success.
This goddess was conceived as a winged being attendant
upon both Zeus and Athena, who, as we
have seen, controlled the destinies of war.</p>

<p>To Nike then, this winged goddess of victory,
was due the wonderful success of Demetrius over
Ptolemy's fleet before Salamis, and it was fitting
that her statue should commemorate the event.
The spot chosen for it was the island of Samothrace,
which stands so high above water level that it is
very conspicuous in the northern Greek archipelago.</p>

<p>The goddess was represented standing on the
prow of a vessel as if leading the fleet to success.
It may be that the old Greek idea of a goddess at
the prow was the origin of the "figure head" for
so many years carried by every ship that sailed the
seas. The vessels in those old days were called
<i>triremes</i>, being propelled by rowers who sat at their
oars in three <i>tiers</i>, or banks, which gave the name
to the craft. The goddess stood in the middle of
what was called the <i>ikrion proras</i>, which would correspond
to the forecastle deck. In her right hand
she held a trumpet to her lips, and in her left she
carried a crosstree, the framework of a trophy.</p>

<p>The figure is in an erect poise with the chest held
high. You will notice that a walker making his
way against the wind bends the body forward to
resist its force, while one who is borne along on
some vehicle in the face of the wind steadies himself
upright. So with Nike; the attitude expresses the
sense of exhilaration from the rush of wind in the
face of one borne along on a moving vessel. The
breeze beats the thin drapery back upon her, outlining
the beautiful curves of bust and limb, and
fluttering behind her in the air. The broad pinions
which would retard the ship's motion if spread open
are folded to cut the air like the prow.</p>

<p>When the statue was set up and the colossal figure
in white marble was seen against the blue sky
of a southern land, what an inspiration it must have
been as a symbol of success! What discouraged
heart could look at such a figure and not be thrilled
with new ambition! The statue of Nike was not
the only tribute to the victory of Demetrius. Some
special coins were struck in honor of the event, including
gold staters and silver tetradrachms, specimens
of which still exist. The design on the obverse
of these coins represented the statue of Nike.</p>

<p>Years passed, and at length the independence of
the Greeks was crushed under the heel of the Roman
conqueror. Many places were laid waste throughout
the peninsula and the Greek islands. Temples
were destroyed and pillaged, and statues were thrown
from their pedestals and buried beneath the soil and
débris. Our statue of Nike shared the sad fate
which befell so many other great works of art. For
centuries it lay in fragments in the ruins surrounding
a temple in Samothrace. Then came the explorer
with pickaxe and shovel, some of the precious
bits were recovered, and learned men set to work to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

put them together again. The coins of Demetrius
were their guide, and the tiny figure of Nike engraved
thereon was the model after which the great
statue was reconstructed.</p>

<p>The head and arms are still missing, and a fanciful
conceit might suggest that these losses were the
marks of a hard-fought battle. Success has been
dearly bought, but the goddess emerges, erect and
undaunted, her tattered wings beating the air victoriously.
As we look at the statue we think less of
what it lacks than of what it is. Perhaps if head
and arms were there we should not have eyes for the
glorious lines in the figure itself. One particularly
fine line is the continuous curve running across the
bust and the arched top of the wings.</p>

<p>The figure gives us a sense of motion which fairly
quickens the blood in our veins. We, too, seem to
feel the strong salt breeze in our faces, speeding
through the air with courage high, and hope steadily
set toward victory.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>

<h2>PERICLES</h2>

<p>In the history of ancient Greece the half century
included between the years 480 and 430 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>
is called the Age of Pericles. During forty years
of this period Pericles was the political leader of
Athens. Under his guidance the city reached the
height of her power as the capital of an empire composed
of tributary states. Nor was political power
the chief glory of Athens at this time. She was the
centre of arts and science for the whole world. This
was the age of great Greek literature, when Æschylus,
Sophocles, and Euripides wrote their immortal
dramas. It was also the age of great oratory, when
the Athenians constantly heard "the purest lessons
of patriotism put forth in the loftiest forms of eloquence."
Finally, it was the age of great art, when
architecture and sculpture attained perfection and
when Phidias, the foremost Greek sculptor, produced
his masterpieces.</p>

<p>Pericles was the dominating spirit in all this brilliant
company. It was his able statesmanship which
made and executed the ambitious plans for the
aggrandizement of the city. It was, moreover, his
generalship which carried out successfully so many
military expeditions. His eloquence gave him great

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>

influence over the people. He had the art of controlling
men and moving their passions as a musician
plays on the strings of his instrument. Upon his
return from the Samian war he delivered a remarkable
funeral oration on those who had fallen in battle.
Still again, his oration in honor of the heroes
of the Peloponnesian war was a noble eulogy of
Athens and the Athenians.</p>

<p>The part of Pericles' career which interests us
most in our study of Greek art is his zeal in beautifying
Athens with works of architecture and sculpture.
He covered the Acropolis, as the great hill in
Athens was called, with beautiful buildings richly
adorned with sculpture. He appointed Phidias superintendent
of all the public edifices, and employed
the most skilled workmen. Besides many temples,
a theatre for music, called an <i>odeum</i>, was built, and
Pericles introduced into the Panathenaic festival a
contest in music held in this place. In addition to
the public buildings erected, Pericles caused a long
wall to be built to surround the city with fortifications.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that all these improvements
cost a great deal of money, and there were not lacking
men who criticised Pericles for extravagance
in the use of public funds. In an assembly of the
people, the great statesman called upon them to say
if they thought he had spent too much. "Yes,"
came the answer. "Then," said he, "be it charged
to my account, not yours, only let the edifices be
inscribed with my name, not that of the people of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>

Athens." At this they cried out that he might
spend all he pleased of the public funds, and the
criticism was silenced. The story shows the quick
wit of the orator, as well as his knowledge of human
nature. He knew he was safe in appealing to the
pride of the people in their city.</p>

<p>At the close of his long career Pericles was seized
with the plague, and lay sick unto death. As his
friends gathered about his death-bed they recounted
his great deeds and many victories. Suddenly he
interrupted them by exclaiming that they were praising
only those qualities in which he was no greater
than other men. In his own estimate, the most
honorable trait of his character was that "no Athenian
through his means had ever put on mourning."</p>

<p>Pericles was in fact a true patriot and a benefactor
of his people. In the administration of public
affairs he showed an upright and honorable character.
Though all his life handling the public funds
and increasing the wealth of the state, it is said that
he added not one drachma to his own estate. He
managed his private fortune with great prudence
and dispensed many charities to the needy. His
manners were calm and moderate, and he never
gave way to envy or anger. His biographer, Plutarch,
has written of him that "where severity was
required, no man was ever more moderate, or if
mildness was necessary, no man better kept up his
dignity than Pericles."</p>

<p>Pericles was a man of fine and striking presence,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>

with a countenance cast in the mould we have come
to know as the typical Greek. His head was somewhat
abnormally long, and the nickname "onion
head" was given him on this account. Plutarch
says that this peculiarity accounts for the fact that
he was always represented in portraits as wearing a
helmet.</p>

<p>We have reason to believe that the bust reproduced
in our frontispiece was made soon after his
successful war against Samos. It represents him
then in the fullness of his manhood and at the height
of his success and popularity. The handsome face
is full of refinement and shows the calm, equable
temperament which made him a leader. His qualities
